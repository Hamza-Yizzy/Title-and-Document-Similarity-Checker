Bismillah,

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and distinguished guests,

It is a great honor to stand before you today and share a little about my journey and the work I am privileged to be a part of. My name is Dr. Cabiir Ciisa Ibraahiim, and I come from the beautiful country of Syria. Over the past twelve years, I have dedicated my professional life to improving the healthcare of children, particularly focusing on treating childhood diseases, newborns, and those born with low birth weight. My journey has led me to Mogadishu, Somalia, where I currently serve as a medical specialist at Horyaal Hospital.

In my medical practice, every day is a reminder of the resilience of our youngest patients and the importance of compassion in the treatment we provide. I am fortunate to be in a position where I can offer medical care that makes a difference in the lives of these children and their families. But my work does not stop there. As the chairman of the Center for Disability and Patience in Somalia, I am committed to advocating for those who often find themselves marginalized in our society. Through this center, we strive to promote inclusivity and empower those with disabilities to live full, meaningful lives.

In addition to my medical work, I am deeply involved in a variety of projects focused on innovation, education, and financial inclusion. As part of a dynamic team, I am developing an e-learning platform that aims to make education more accessible for people across Somalia. This platform will serve as a resource for students, professionals, and anyone looking to gain new skills and improve their lives through learning.

Furthermore, I have embarked on a research journey to explore the reasons why so many young people in Somalia, despite their potential, choose not to pursue higher education. My research paper, “Exploring the Reasons for Non-Enrollment in Universities among Somali Secondary School Graduates,” aims to identify the socio-economic pressures and alternative opportunities that shape the decisions of these young individuals. This project, which is very close to my heart, holds the potential to change the future of education in Somalia and unlock opportunities for countless students who deserve a chance to succeed.

Beyond my professional life, I have taken on the task of contributing to the broader economic landscape. Currently, I am developing a social media strategy for Somali Somali Bank to promote financial services, enhance digital literacy, and increase financial inclusion in our community. It is my firm belief that when we make financial services more accessible, we open the doors to a brighter future for all.

As I continue on this journey, I am driven by a passion for service, for progress, and for uplifting the lives of those around me. It is not the accolades or titles that motivate me, but the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the lives of children, families, and communities.

In closing, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all who have supported and continue to support my work. I am excited about the road ahead, and I look forward to collaborating with many of you in the years to come as we build a brighter, more inclusive future for Somalia and beyond.

Thank you.

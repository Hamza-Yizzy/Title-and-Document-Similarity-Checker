Bismillah,

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and distinguished guests,

It is a great honor to stand before you today and share a little about my journey and the work I am privileged to be a part of. My name is Dr. Cabiir Ciisa Ibraahiim, and I come from the beautiful country of Syria. Over the past twelve years, I have dedicated my professional life to improving the healthcare of children, particularly focusing on treating childhood diseases, newborns, and those born with low birth weight. My journey has led me to Mogadishu, Somalia, where I currently serve as a medical specialist at Horyaal Hospital.

In my medical practice, every day is a reminder of the resilience of our youngest patients and the importance of compassion in the treatment we provide. I am fortunate to be in a position where I can offer medical care that makes a difference in the lives of these children and their families. But my work does not stop there. As the chairman of the Center for Disability and Patience in Somalia, I am committed to advocating for those who often find themselves marginalized in our society. Through this center, we strive to promote inclusivity and empower those with disabilities to live full, meaningful lives.

In addition to my medical work, I am deeply involved in a variety of projects focused on innovation, education, and financial inclusion. As part of a dynamic team, I am developing an e-learning platform that aims to make education more accessible for people across Somalia. This platform will serve as a resource for students, professionals, and anyone looking to gain new skills and improve their lives through learning.

Furthermore, I have embarked on a research journey to explore the reasons why so many young people in Somalia, despite their potential, choose not to pursue higher education. My research paper, “Exploring the Reasons for Non-Enrollment in Universities among Somali Secondary School Graduates,” aims to identify the socio-economic pressures and alternative opportunities that shape the decisions of these young individuals. This project, which is very close to my heart, holds the potential to change the future of education in Somalia and unlock opportunities for countless students who deserve a chance to succeed.
Beyond my professional life, I am deeply committed to contributing to the development of a more inclusive and sustainable future. One of my key endeavors at the moment is working on an e-learning platform that aims to break down barriers to education for individuals across Somalia. This platform will provide a space for knowledge and skills development, especially for those who lack access to traditional educational institutions. I firmly believe that education is the foundation upon which we can build a better society, and by making it more accessible, we empower individuals to unlock their full potential.

In addition to this, I am passionate about using technology to drive positive social change. As part of my broader efforts, I am engaged in developing strategies that will promote financial literacy and inclusion. This involves working on initiatives that bridge the gap in access to financial services, enabling individuals and businesses to thrive in a digital economy. By equipping our community with the tools to succeed, I am confident that we can create lasting change and offer brighter prospects for future generations.

As I move forward on this journey, I remain motivated not by titles or recognition, but by the opportunity to serve, to bring about progress, and to uplift the lives of those around me. Each day presents new challenges and opportunities, and I approach them with unwavering dedication to making a real difference.

I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all who have supported me in these endeavors. I look forward to the path ahead and the collaborations we will forge as we work together to create a brighter and more equitable future for Somalia and the world.

Thank you.
